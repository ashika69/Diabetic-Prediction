# Diabetes Prediction

**Description**

This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes a dataset of medical predictor variables, such as pregnancies, BMI, insulin level, age, etc., to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project consists of 768 observation units and 9 variables. It includes information on the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, age, and the outcome (diabetes or no diabetes).

**Methodology**

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** 
    - Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand the data distribution, correlations, and missing values.
    - Missing values are handled by imputation techniques.
    - Outliers are detected and treated.
    - Feature engineering is applied to create new features that may enhance model performance.
    - Categorical variables are encoded using one-hot encoding.
    - Data is standardized using RobustScaler.

2. **Model Selection and Training:** 
    - Various machine learning models are evaluated, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost.
    - Model performance is assessed using cross-validation.
    - Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the selected models.

3. **Evaluation:** 
    - The final model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    - Variable importance is analyzed to understand the contribution of each feature to the prediction.

**Results**

- The best performing model is XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning, achieving an accuracy of [insert accuracy score].
- The most significant features for prediction are [list important features].

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting diabetes. The developed model can be used as a tool to aid in early diagnosis and intervention.
